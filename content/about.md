[//]: # (![me-at-grill-the-data]&#40;/about/me-at-grill-the-data.jpg&#41;)

I am a technology leader and entrepreneur with over a decade of experience 
building scalable systems and leading technical teams across diverse industries. 
My career spans from pioneering cloud-based 3D object recognition research to 
architecting enterprise platforms that serve thousands of users.

As founder of Guerrilla Tech Co. Ltd., I've delivered full-stack solutions 
across gaming, inventory management, warehouse systems, and ERP integrations 
for clients ranging from startups to established enterprises. My technical 
expertise includes modern JavaScript frameworks (Vue.js, Quasar), backend 
systems (Node.js), and various databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MS SQL), 
with a strong focus on cloud architecture and system security.

I've also served as CTO at Baania Thailand, where I built their online property 
marketplace ecosystem, and at SEEK ONE Group, where I developed innovative 
solutions making blue-collar employment more efficient through technology. 
These leadership roles have strengthened my ability to scale teams, architect
complex systems, and translate business vision into technical reality.

Beyond building products, I'm passionate about knowledge sharing. As a former 
lecturer at Stamford International University, I taught programming, database 
design, mobile development, and information security. I continue to advise 
companies on platform development and microservices architecture.

I thrive at the intersection of emerging technologies and practical business 
solutions, consistently delivering systems that drive measurable impact.
